## Requirements
1. Create project using **XH Generator** - https://github.com/xhtmlized/generator-xh
2. Use HTML5 / SCSS
3. Create page called Home and place the elements on it
4. Use CSS3 PIE to add CSS3 support to IE8
5. Add Colorbox (http://www.jacklmoore.com/colorbox/) as a Bower dependency and open sample photos in the news section as an image group / gallery like follows:
  * When the page loads open the first photo in colorbox automatically (without user clicking on the image).
