1. Create project using [XH Generator](https://github.com/xfiveco/generator-xh)
2. Use HTML5 / SCSS
3. Make the design responsive
4. Create a simple custom overlay for photos - use only vanilla JavaScript, do not use jQuery or any other external libraries for it. You can use Browserify in XH Generator
5. Create some hover effect for the image thumbnails
6. Make the page smallest possible size - ensure that images are properly optimized, resources minified, etc.
7. *Optional bonus task:* Make the back button in browser work properly with the overlays.
